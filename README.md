# UnicodeSupportForFesapiCs
These files can replace their equivalent in fesapi in order to get Unicode support for Fesapi CSharp. You must reconfigure/regenerate your build with cmake after replacement.

Fesapi is released under Apache 2.0 license.
These files are released under The Code Project Open License (CPOL): http://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx.

Because [CPOL license is not compatible with Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x), these files are delivered in a separate repository than fesapi.
